Hello, we have created this Simulator as per the instructions given by our instructors and the "Instruction File", just write "./run --no-sim"
(Without Quotes) in the Bash in Ubuntu.also by some changes in the code (Which are now commented (but not removed) you can give input through the file print the output in
another file.The Conversion data will be printed only if all the instructions inside the input file or BASH commands are error free
as per the error checking given by the instructors.

Our code can handle almost every exceptions along with all the exceptions given by the TA's or Instruction File
