Hello, we have created this Assembler as per the instructions given by our instructors and the file uploaded, you have to provide the input <br/>
file at the starting of the program and also the to_print to be updated so that it can print the data into the requested file. The Conversion data<br/>
 will be printed only if all the instructions inside the input file are **error free** as per the error checking given by the instructors.<br/>
 
 **Our code can handle almost every exceptions along with all the exceptions given by the TA's or Instruction File**<br />


Happy Coding! ^_^
